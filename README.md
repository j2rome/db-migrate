SUMMARY
-------

dbash-migrate is a tool which performs migration tasks like rake db:migrate command in Ruby.

dbash-migrate is a database versionning and migration tool inspired from Rails migrations.
This tool enables to manage and track database schema changes.

Rake (db:migrate task) is a powerful tool to perform database migration, but we have to installed Ruby and Rake on your host. 
Such tools to manage projects (not using Ruby) are not always allowed on production server for some reasons.
So, just to clone a sub tasks of rake db:migrate to perform database versionning and migration only in Bash.

PREREQUISITES
-------------

* Bash

INSTALLATION
------------
```shell
chmod +x db.sh
```

Every script migration is contained in directory under db/migrate.
Each script name is composed by a timestamp and a description :
 db/migrate/20121211185339_a_description_for_this_migration.sh

This script skeleton is generated by generate_migration.sh
In the future I will merge all in one file.
